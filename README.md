This is a simple image converter written in python3 as part of the Zero to Mastery: Complete Python Developer coursework.

This takes an input folder with JPG images and creates an output folder with the same images in PNG format us the PIL library.

To use this program, download or clone this project.  Put the input folder in the root directory. 
On the command line, go to the root directory of the project, run JPGtoPNGconverter.py with python and input the input folder name as the first argument, and the output folder name as the second arguement.
If the output folder does not exist, it will be created.
From the course, a "Pokedex" folder was provided. To test the project on this folder in the CLI you would enter:
